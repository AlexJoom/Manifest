#  The Things Network

The Thins Network is an open decentralised crowd sourced IoT data network

## Vision

The internet was created by people that connected their networks and allowed traffic from, to and over their network to pass for free. Because everybody did this, there was a huge synergy.

The Things Network is doing the same thing for the IoT network of the future.

Internet of Things is demanding a long range, low battery and low cost solution for delivering sensor data and pushing control data between the cloud and devices.

With the law of Moore as our friend computer equipment costs are decreasing over time exponentially. The new generation of network devices reaches price points which allow us to crowd source the network.

With current technologies it is possible to build a community owned low cost data network. A country like The Netherlands reaches complete coverage with less than 80 gateways. A city like Amsterdam only needs 5 gateways at the cost of a laptop.

Use cases range from a low cost position trackers in a shipping container to a small bracelet for you cat so you will always be able to find it.

Everybody should be able to put sensor data on the ether and fetch the data online. No monopolies or limited player markets should be allowed here.

## Mission

Our mission is to build a decentralised technology independent IoT network, owned and operated by itâ€™s users.

We are building a distributed network that supports all IoT connectivity which is democratic from the ground up. A net neutral distributed installed base of gateways connected through a distributed data network to ensure no single entity will dominate the IoT.

We are the network.

We are building the network with the following principles:

* **Your data is your data** - data is encrypted end to end.
* **Net neutrality** - all data is treated equally.
* **Open source** - technology developed in the stack is made open source.

## The Plan

We are crowdsourcing the network. From the network equipment, the installation points to the decentralised data store.

The Things Network kicks off in Amsterdam. We have already gathered a group of contributors that will create a network completely covering the city. Several partners are building their startups on top of this network. This result will work as a blue print for the rest of the world.


## Community

The goal of the community is to build a world wide open decentralised internet of things internet.

Decentralisation is at the core of everything. It is embeded in the architecture and every design decision. In all ways we will prevent a single entity of being in control of the network.
